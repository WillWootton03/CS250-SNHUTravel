--How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

-User needs should be accurately recorded and assebled to understand what users place as the most important need and want in a product, for example in something like a travel booking app something that seemed to be important is for the user to be able to select likes and dislikes for different aspects of a vacation. This was identified within the user stories and adapted into the an idea for likes and dislikes based on location, type of stay, and nearby activities for the first iteration. The ultimate goal is to go through iteration as long as possible to constantly improve the product and keep users satisfied and coming back to SNHU Travel in this case.

--How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

-Agile has been my favorite discovery throughout schooling so far, when I work on my own projects I tend to use something similair to an agile style but it was never detailed and tended to be just how I felt in the moment. From now on though I will use the agile method in both professional and personal settings when working on a project as it helps me keep my style and love to keep things constantly changing and evolving based on new ideas and any feedback, while giving it a structure that I have found myself desperately lacking when pursuing personal projects at some times.

--What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

-In my opinion the best thing I can do in any role is always put my best foot forward and listen to those around me. For most of my work life I will not be the most experienced person and will constantly have those around me who have spent a longer time in our same field. This gives a perfect opportunity to learn, I have found myself very entranced with computer science and coding and find myself actively searching for new things I can learn or new mehtods to achieve something and I do not plan to stop after school. I hopefully have a long life and career ahead of me which gives me plenty of time to soak in new information that I hope to use in projects, this also means to help others and communicate my own knowledge onto them in any way I can. All in all the best way I can be a good team member is communicating, listening, and always trying to put forward my best work while always looking to improve.
